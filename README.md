#  ðŸ—’âœ… Stuff To Do

This is a simple to-do list implemented in vanilla JavaScript following object oriented programming concepts.

You're provided with a dashboard where you can add categories of _stuff to do_. You can add new tasks, mark them as done, or plain delete them. Deleting a category will remove all associated tasks.

 Data persistence is provided through localStorage.

# OOP ?

This is the conversion of a functional vanilla JavaScript app (recommended: see full tutorial below!) into a javascript OOP todolist.
